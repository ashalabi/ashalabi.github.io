## Ahmed Shalabi

Hi there. My name is Ahmed Shalabi. I graduated from college, majoring in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I am passionate asbout technology and view it as my opportunity to make this world better for all of us! I'm currently employed at GLOBALFOUNDRIES as a part of the Design For Manufacturing team. It's essentially a team under Design Enablement -- our goal is to improve designs by providing tool decks that help designers avoid patterns that are known or linked to detracting yield.

I'm currently working on a project on the side trying to apply deep learning algorithms to identify objects using a Jetson TX2 board from NVIDIA. 

### Accomplishments

1. Building genetic algorithm to optimize standard cells.
2. Top 30% in a ~440 team kaggle competition hosted by Google to predict NYC Taxi Fares.
